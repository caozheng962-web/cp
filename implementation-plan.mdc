# Implementation Plan - Live Stream KT Board Evaluation Tool

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Initialization
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- [x] Set up project structure (components, pages/app, styles, utils).
- [x] Configure UI components (buttons, cards, forms) using Tailwind.
